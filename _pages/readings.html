        <h3><a href="https://www.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page">Linux Kernel Newbies</a></h3>
        <p>Linux Kernel Newbies is my go‑to reference when I need a grounded, practical explanation of kernel subsystems. It collects guides, notes, and curated links that help me navigate device drivers, memory management, scheduling, and debugging workflows. I use it to cross‑check terminology, trace concepts to primary sources, and keep a crisp map of the kernel ecosystem while building or reviewing low‑level work.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese5320/">ESE 5320: SOC-Architecture</a></h3>
        <p>The ESE 5320 course page is a compact, high‑signal hub for embedded software and systems. It provides lecture material, labs, and project context that align with the way I structure firmware builds, testing, and documentation. I revisit it to refresh architecture patterns, review lab expectations, and borrow clean teaching examples that translate directly into real‑world embedded workflows.</p>

        <span class="badge">Blog</span>
        <h3><a href="https://github.blog/">GitHub Blog</a></h3>
        <p>The GitHub Blog is where I track platform changes and engineering decisions that affect day‑to‑day development. It covers product updates, security advisories, and deep dives into tooling and infrastructure. I read it to understand new workflows, anticipate CI/CD or security policy shifts, and pick up pragmatic tips from real engineering teams shipping and maintaining large‑scale codebases.</p>
